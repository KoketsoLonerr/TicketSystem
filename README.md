## Introduction
This Java Ticket System is designed to provide tech support for a school environment. It allows students, teachers, and staff members to submit their tech-related issues, such as software errors,
hardware malfunctions, network problems, etc. The system ensures that these issues are properly tracked, managed, and resolved by the support team.

## Features
- Ticket Submission: Users can create new tickets, specifying the problem and other relevant details.
- Ticket Assignment: Support agents can assign tickets to themselves or other team members based on their expertise.
- Ticket Status Tracking: Users can monitor the status of their tickets and receive updates on their progress.
- Ticket Resolution: Support agents can update ticket status, add notes, and mark tickets as resolved once the issue is fixed.
- Dashboard: Provides an overview of open and closed tickets for easy monitoring.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the ticket system, ensure you have the following installed:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later
- Apache Maven
- MySQL or any other compatible relational database management system
- Git (optional, for version control)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-ticket-system.git
   ```
   Alternatively, you can download the project as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd java-ticket-system
   ```

3. Compile the application using Maven:
   ```
   mvn clean package
   ```

## Database Setup
1. Create a new database in your MySQL server for the ticket system.

2. Configure the database connection in the `application.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory. Modify the following properties to match your MySQL configuration:
   ```
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ticket_system_db
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```

3. The application will automatically create the necessary tables in the database upon the first run.

## Usage
1. Run the application using Maven:
   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

2. Access the ticket system through your web browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

3. Users can sign up or log in to submit tickets and check their ticket status.
